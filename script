Hi everybody, Florestan here coming to you from the Netherlands.

So, just picture yourself coming back from a lovely vacation, 
you shot a million pictures and now you have to find the ones that you don't want to keep because they're too dark or unsharp. 

If you're anything like me you're also constantly running out of disk space, and because stacking even more external hard-disks is not an option anymore, I decided to finally tackle this problem. 

Before my work as a webdeveloper I studied photography at the Art Academy here in The Hague. I did that for four and a half years and then worked as a freelance photographer and image editor. Both jobs required me to go through hundreds if not thousands of pictures a day and building a huge library of image files which are just sitting on my hard disk, taking up space. 

And because going through all of my images is a time-consuming proces I came up with 'Image Delete CLI', the working title of my final project for 'Harvard's CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science'.

With my newly acquired superpowers of programming, I can automate the evaluation process. I did this by leveraging the power(? synonym) of Python which I used to write an algorithm that figures out when a picture is well exposed and well focussed.

The Command Line Interface requests the following input from the user:
* the path to a folder where the pictures are stored, 
* brightness and sharpness thresholds to determine the parameters, 

It then recursively looks for images in the provided folder and deletes the ones that aren't good enough according to calculations based on the parameters provided by the user.

My focus for this assignmemnt was to create a useful, robust tool with pleasant user experience, graceful error handling, written in a way that is easy to share and maintain. 


So I hope you like my project and may the best pictures survive!
Peace!
